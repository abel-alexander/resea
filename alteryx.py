- Remove any formatting noise, irrelevant text, or artifacts that may have been extracted incorrectly.
- Maintain the correct order of sections as they appear in the text.
- Do not add page numbers.
- Do not infer missing sections—return only what is explicitly present in the text.

#### **Extracted Text from First Page:**
```{extracted_text}```

#### **Expected Output Format:**
